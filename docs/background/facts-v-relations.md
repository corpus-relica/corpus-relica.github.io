# Facts Vs. Relations

At base the semantic model is expressed as a set of "relation" triples, e.g.

`Relica : is a specialization of : computer system`

`left-hand object : relation type : right-hand object`

However the relations are used to describe a slightly more abstract model of "_facts_" 

There are 3 types of facts used in the semantic model:

- **unary facts** - a single relation where the left-hand and right-hand object are the same entity (i.e. in synonym and inverse relations)
- **binary facts** - (most common type) relates two and only two entities. maps directly onto the fact triple representation.
- **higher order facts** - where more than two entities are involved. importantly, expressed as a set of relations. (e.g. occurrence)

The facts are further used to describe knowledge at various levels of logical abstraction. Notabley, this description includes comprehensive information about the meta-structure of the semantic model itself.

 The model not only allows for the descrption of "what is the case" through relations between concepts but further it allows and necessitates description of the relations themselves, including which concepts are allowed to be involved in which relations. The use of these facts to erect the fundamental scaffolding which enables this semantic demensionality is further described below.

The matrix of relation categorization is further extrapolated along the dimension of intended utility. More than relations just being categorized based on the number of involved entities, structurally speaking, they are also considered according to how they serve to bolster the structure of the semantic model.  in these terms there are 3 types of relations:

- **elementary relation** - a binary relation, describes the relation between the *atomic relation* and an involved thing and the role that that involved thing plays
  - that something plays a role (in a fact)
  - that that a fact requires a role (of a particular kind)
- **atomic facts** an atomic fact is express as two or more involvement relations(*elementary relations*)

.. so on and so forth
