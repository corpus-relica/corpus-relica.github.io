# Introduction

We exist ever presently at a momemnt of transition on a multi-dimensional technological continuum.

The personal computer of today (and its derivitives) has it's roots in an aspirational, almost eutopic, vision for enabling human beings to confront complex problems and more deeply express themselves.

The status quo of todays computing also represents a stagnation in the pursuit of that vision.

The envelope of the adjacent possible often expands at points of least resistance, recent advances in computing technology infer such leverage as to make revisiting some less popular techniques/strategies compelling.

In computing systems, the orginization of underlying data implies alot for the expressivity of the system itself.

The status quo approach to data organization in the PC is a twentieth century legacy based on 2-dimensional paper.

A more natural analogy would be an organization based on networks of concepts.
